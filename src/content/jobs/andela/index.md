- Andela places software engineers from Africa to work with global tech companies
  as full-time, distributed teams.
- Through Andela, I have worked on three products, iReporter, AuthorsHaven and Converge.
  Converge is a meeting room management system, that allows Andelans to schedule meetings (leveraging on the Google Calendar API), book rooms, invite attendees
  to the meetings and also give feedback about the state of the rooms.
- Worked with a variety of different languages, platforms, and frameworks such as Python, JavaScript, Flask, Django, React, React Native, CircleCI, TravisCI and Heroku.
- Communicate with multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, designers, producers, and clients on a daily basis
