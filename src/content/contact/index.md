I am currently open to new opportunities. I work on backend
engineering(designing and implementing APIs) and consume this APIs
on the front-end with React js. I occasionally use React-Native for
mobile apps development too.

Preferred tech: Python Flask, Python Django, GraphQL, React js.

I am also open to relocate.

And if you just want to say hi, feel free! My inbox is open :)
