Hello! I'm Issa Ian Mwangi Maina. I'm a Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya, who enjoys solving problems through code. Apart from coding, I enjoy watching and playing soccer in my free time.

I design, develop and deploy backend services (APIs) with focus on high availability, low latency and scalability. I also write client-facing code that consume web services.

My strongest professional areas include effective communication between my teammates, and stakeholders. I seamlessly interface with UX designers, our PM and other stakeholders to ensure thoughtful and coherent user experiences. I also give reliable and kind feedback and I'm always open to receiving feedback. I am always ready to help unblock my teammates whenever they are faced with blockers. I also do not shy away from asking for help whenever I am stuck.

Immediately after completing my Bachelor's Degree, I joined a fast growing African tech
startup, [Andela](https://andela.com) as a software engineer!

Here's a few technologies I've been working with recently:
