Hello! I'm Ruto Collins. Here they call me Kaka, a Swahili word I love. I'm a Software Engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya who enjoys solving problems through code. I design, develop and deploy backend services (APIs) with focus on high availability, low latency and scalability. I also occassionally write client-facing code that consume web services.

My coding life story starts during my sophomore year in college, after we had a
Computer Science lecturer take us through what was very new to us, C and C++ programming. To cut the long story
short, I quit school later that year to join a fast growing African tech
startup, [Andela](https://andela.com) as a software engineer!
